#this is for my si106 class and I need two people make at least one commit that changes the contents of a single file. Each commit must have a “commit message” that explains what was changed.
===========
#this is a commit 
nums = [0,1,2,5,6,7,2,35,26,7,2,1,67,53,2,5,740,32]
accum = 0
for bch in nums:
  accum = accum + bch

# I have added code that will add up all the numbers in the list nums.
